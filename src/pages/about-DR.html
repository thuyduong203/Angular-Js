      It all started in 2010, when people were carried away by the emerging
      temptations in life and started to doubt true love. We decided to make it
      count when two lovers woo; we wanted to sweeten up the relationship by
      encouraging lovers to challenge themselves to a life-long promise. Not
      necessarily a great growth strategy, but we have always adhered to our
      principles since the day we launched: one can only buy a ring for the only
      love. It is a practice of true love and an expression of determination. In
      a decade, more than one million couples chose us and told their love
      stories, proving that true lovers are not rare species. At DR, we are
      devoted to being a witness to your life-long true love, because we're in
      it for a lifetime, too.
